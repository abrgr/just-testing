## This project was created with Super Cool Service and a bounty of $xxx was placed on its completion.
Super Cool Service is a site for programmers, by programmers.
Some other programmer needs this module and is willing to pay you for your work.

## Please note, this is NOT open source.
This is proprietary software.
If you choose to contribute, your work becomes the property of the buyer and we may delete all Github forks once the project is completed.

## What's that?  You want to implement this for $xxx?
Just fork the repo, create a PR, and, when it's merged, you can sign up at SuperCoolService.com to get paid.

## Is this for real?  How do I know I'll be paid?
Yes. This IS for real.
The buyer's credit card is on file at SuperCoolService.com and our crack team of programmers resolve any disputes (we don't have many).
Plus, all work is out in the open. 
This transparency means that the best work wins.
Buyers get the well-designed, well-tested, robust modules that they ask for and you get the extra cash we all want in exchange for working on a problem we think you'll find pretty interesting.

## Oh, YOU want to put a bounty on a project with Super Cool Service?
After you sign up, you can create a project on our site or just create a repo and add a webhook for https://supercoolservice.com/hook?bounty=100.00
We recommend you list single-purpose, smaller modules that would take between a few hours and two weeks.
